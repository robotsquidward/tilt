# [tilt](http://ajkueterman.com/tilt)

tilt - today i learned that - is a simple 'fun-fact' app that uses the power of Wikipedia to bring you random facts on demand.

There is no account, logins, preferences, or otherwise.  tilt is a dead-simple interface with a UX design reminiscent of classic design standards manuals.  You can grab new facts on demand, read about each in-depth, and browse related articles if you stumble on a thread you want to pull.

Check it out, and maybe learn a thing or two.
